# username = "your_username"
# password = "your_password"

# Example: Cloud storage (if you add cloud storage later)
# [aws]
# access_key_id = "your_access_key"
# secret_access_key = "your_secret_key"
# bucket_name = "mes-storage"

# Example: API keys (if you add external APIs later)
# [apis]
# google_api_key = "your_google_api_key"
